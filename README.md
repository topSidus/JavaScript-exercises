# JavaScript-exercises
I'm learning this language and it's my first real programming language. Hope I'll learn it and get to master it after 2 years of writing HMTL CSS and Front-end. 

I'm planning to run this on Linux in September, because of the larger amount of available configuration. I have just seen some cool stuff for terminal in Linux and I would really love to use it as well as Linux, but I think I'll have free time for it on September.

Right now I'm just focusing on some good excercise in JavaScript, understand the basics and try to personalize and write my own pieces of code. 

If you have some suggestion or question, please feel free to watch, fork and eventually collaborating in modified branches.
